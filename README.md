## Customization

### Risk Thresholds
You can modify risk thresholds in the JavaScript code:
```javascript
this.riskThresholds = {
    low: { temp: 35, humidity: 80, wind: 50, aqi: 100 },
    medium: { temp: 30, humidity: 70, wind: 40, aqi: 80 },
    high: { temp: 25, humidity: 60, wind: 30, aqi: 60 }
};
```

### City Areas
Add or modify city areas in the `addCityMarkers()` function:
```javascript
const cityAreas = [
    { lat: 40.7589, lng: -73.9851, name: 'Times Square', population: 50000, risk: 'medium' },
    // Add more areas here
];
```

## Troubleshooting

### Weather Data Not Loading
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you haven't exceeded the API rate limit

### Location Not Working
- Ensure location services are enabled in your browser
